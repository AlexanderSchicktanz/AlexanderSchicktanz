## Student

I am a student in 11th grade and my favourite subjects are Math and CS.

## Programmer

I have been programming for two years now and I love it.  
It gives you incredible freedom and power.  
Is there something you donÂ´t like about a software?  
Just program your own version!  
This of course is made easier nowadays by the rise of open-source software,  
that you can change and tweek to your liking.  
The only limit is your imagination - and your processing power.

## Physics Enthusiast

While I am far from being a real physicist, I do enjoy reading and learning about my fair share of theses and formulas.  
I especially like the works of Einstein, Lorentz and Maxwell.
